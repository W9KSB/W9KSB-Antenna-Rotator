# W9KSB-Antenna-Rotator

## About This Project

This project is **not a polished commercial product**. It is a real-world, homebrew build that grew out of practical needs, experimentation, and a lot of tinkering.

The W9KSB Antenna Rotator exists because I wanted a reliable way to automate satellite tracking and reception from home without expensive commercial hardware. Along the way, the project evolved through trial, error, discussion, and learning — exactly how most good DIY projects do.

Everything here is shared **as-is**.

There are **no warranties, guarantees, or promises of fitness for any particular purpose**. Hardware, software, and configurations may change over time, and what works in my environment may require adjustment in yours.

For a much more detailed, narrative-style walkthrough of the project — including design decisions, build photos, wiring, mechanical considerations, and real-world usage — the bulk of the documentation lives on my website:

The GitHub repository is intended to host the source code and supporting files, while the website serves as the primary place for longer-form explanations and project updates.

## Intent and Philosophy

This repository is shared with the following goals:

- To document the build honestly — including decisions, tradeoffs, and limitations  
- To give others a starting point for their own experiments  
- To encourage learning, modification, and improvement  
- To contribute back to the broader ham radio, SDR, and maker communities  

This is an **off-hours hobby project**, not a product or service. I don’t have the ability to provide ongoing support, custom builds, or troubleshooting for individual setups, but I wanted to share the work for others who enjoy building, experimenting, and figuring things out.

## Collaboration and Credit

Many people have influenced this project indirectly through:

- Discussions  
- Code examples  
- Ideas and design approaches  
- Prior art shared online  

Where applicable, I’ve tried to respect and acknowledge those influences. This repository represents my own implementation and integration of those ideas, shared in the same open spirit.

If you build on this work, improve it, or adapt it for your own projects, you’re encouraged to share your results as well.

- This project is provided **without formal support**
- Issues may not receive immediate responses
- Feature requests may not be implemented
- Changes may be driven by my own use cases and availability  

That said, respectful discussion, improvements, and pull requests are always welcome.
